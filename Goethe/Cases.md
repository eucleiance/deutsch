### Cases
Cases in grammar refer to the different forms that nouns, pronouns, and sometimes adjectives take to show their function in a sentence.
In German, there are four main cases:
- Nominative
- Accusative
- Dative
- Genitive
##### Nominative case
is used for the ==subject of the sentence==, the person or thing performing the action.
Verbs like "sein" (to be), "werden" (to become), and "bleiben" (to stay) link the subject to a complement that is also in the nominative case.
For example, "Er ist ein Lehrer" (He is a teacher).

##### Accusative case
is used for the ==direct object==, the person or thing directly receiving the action of the verb.
Common accusative verbs include "haben" (to have), "sehen" (to see), and "essen" (to eat).
For instance, "Ich habe einen Hund" (I have a dog).

##### Dative case
is used for the ==indirect object==, the person or thing that benefits from or is affected by the action.
Verbs like "geben" (to give), "helfen" (to help), and "danken" (to thank) require the dative case.
For example, "Ich gebe dem Mann ein Buch" (I give the man a book).

##### Genitive Case
The genitive case is ==used to show possession or close relationships between nouns==, similar to how we use "of" or an apostrophe-s in English.
It indicates whose something is or to whom something belongs.
For example, in the sentence "Das ist das Buch des Lehrers" (That is the teacher's book), "des Lehrers" shows that the book belongs to the teacher.
The genitive case often modifies the noun by adding "-s" or "-es" to indicate possession.
While less frequently used in everyday conversation, it remains important for formal and written German.
